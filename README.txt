	TCP Match Pairs Game
======================================

Changing IP:
By default, everything is set to 127.0.0.1, which is local host.
If you want to run this across multiple devices, the IP needs inside source.cpp for the client needs to be set to the IP of the device running the server

You can also change the port, just be sure to change it in both source.cpp files. The current port should be fine though.
